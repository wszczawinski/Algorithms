## Algorithms

### Binary Search
- **File**: `binarySearch.py`
- **Concept**: Efficiently search for an item in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

### Selection Sort
- **File**: `selectionSort.py`
- **Concept**: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element and moves it to the correct position.

### Recursion
- **File**: `recursion.py`
- **Concept**: A method of solving problems where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

### Divide and Conquer
- **File**: `divideAndConquer.py`
- **Concept**: Break a problem down into smaller, more manageable parts, solve each part individually, and combine the results.

### Quicksort
- **File**: `quickSort.py`
- **Concept**: A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays, which are then sorted recursively.

### Breadth-First Search
- **File**: `breadthFirstSearch.py`
- **Concept**: Explore nodes in a graph layer by layer, ensuring that all nodes at the present depth level are explored before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm
- **File**: `dijkstra.py`
- **Concept**: An algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.

### Greedy Algorithms
- **File**: `greedy.py`
- **Concept**: Algorithms that make the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum.

## How to Run the Code

To run any of the provided Python scripts, ensure that you have Python installed on your machine. You can execute a script from the command line as follows:

```bash
python3 script_name.py
